Dynamic scale up and down:

    - naming server (eureka)
    - ribbon (client side load balancing)
    - feign (easier REST clientes)

Visibility and monitoring:

    - zipkin distributed tracing
    - netflix api gateway

Main advantages of microservices:

    - new technology and process adpatation
    - dynamic scaling
    - faster release cycles

Condiguration stack for each microservice:

    - PROD, STAGE, QA, DEV

1 - Spring Cloud Config Server

    -Responsible for centralizing the configurations of all the micrsoervices within an environment. It stores all the configuration
    inside a git repository. It is the centralized microservices configuration.

    - Dependency: actuator provides monitoring abilities to the project.

Project:

    Name: limits-service
    Dependencies: web, dev-tools, actuator, config-client

    Name: spring-cloud-config-server
    Dependencies: dev-tools, config-server

    Name: currency-exchange-service
    Dependencies: web, dev-tools, actuator, config client

    Name: currency-conversion-service
    Dependencies: web, dev-tools, actuator, config client

Spring Feign:
    - makes easier the connection amongst different micro services
